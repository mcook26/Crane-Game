# Project Abstract
In this final project, we built a crane game controlled by an FPGA and MCU. The MCU will control mutliple stepper motors which allow the user to move a gantry in the x, y, and z directions via an external joystick. The MCU will interface with h-bridges that will provide the necessary power to move the entire carriage.  The FPGA will provide a visual component through a 32x32 LED matrix that will display a timer as well as additional light assortments to convey the different stages of the game.  The entire housing will be constructed out of 80/20 alumninum bars with wood finishes. All together, the user will be able to press a button, move the gantry around, drop the claw, and retrieve their prize. 

# Project Motivation
The motivation behind this project is that we are curious behind the mechanisms behind these common and seemingly simple games. Arcade games have been around for a long time and employ a variety of different hardware and software components, and we believe that it will provide a fun medium to learn more about real world systems. These games require consistent operation under a variety of conditions and extended periods of time so it will also be interested to see how the system responds to multiple tests and the challenges in building a reliable system.
