As kids, we both loved playing in the arcade, and the claw game was a favorite. Additionally, the iconic scene from Toy Story with "The Claw" and the green aliens was a prominent memory of our childhood.  It was fun recreating the device and learning about the nuiances that are missed by simplying playing it.
